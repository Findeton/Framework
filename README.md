## Introduction

Strontium is designed to make it easy to build a TypeScript code base for a Rest API with a focus on allowing the
creation of readable and maintainable code which is possible to test without going for a purely functional design approach.

Throughout the toolkit Strontium takes advantage of types and descriptive errors to make the developer experience fluid
and productive. Each component of Strontium is designed to be independent to allow for a gradual migration whilst still
working well together to build a coherent application.
